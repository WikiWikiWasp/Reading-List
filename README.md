# Watch Us Build With AngularJS - Reading List

*We changed the name of this series to "Watch Us Build," so you may see an occasional reference to its
former name ("Soup to Bits") in this repository.*

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app.
You can use it to quickly bootstrap your angular webapp projects and dev environment for these
projects.

The seed contains a sample AngularJS application and is preconfigured to install the Angular
framework and a bunch of development and testing tools for instant web development gratification.

The seed app doesn't do much, it just shows how to wire two controllers and views together.

## Prerequisites

Code School's Beginning Angular Course: [Shaping up with Angular.js](http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js/intro)

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository and install the dependencies.

```
git clone git@github.com:codeschool/WatchUsBuild-ReadingListAppWithAngularJS.git
cd WatchUsBuild-ReadingListAppWithAngularJS
```

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test angular-seed. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

## Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/).
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager](http://bower.io/).

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

## Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:4000/app/index.html`.
